# Bloc Pac
Bloc Pac is a suite of libraries and components to help developers create UI with Bloc.

This repository contains the code for Bloc that may be included in the future in Pharo.
It retrofits a part of the development made at https://github.com/feenkcom/bloc-pac. 
This version will focus on core features and stability.
We are currently identifying the core we want for Pharo.
